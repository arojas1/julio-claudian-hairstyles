The boy in figure 1 has the Augustan-style hair with the clear part in his hair over the inner corner of his left eye and though the “crab-claw” motif is not as prominent. On the back of his head you can see the star-like shape, but the curls are thicker and in a higher relief than other emperor portraits discussed previously (see [Emperor Hairstyles](../emperor-hairstyles.emperor-hairstyles.md)). 

There was no inscription attached to this bust, however, many believe that it was the Roman emperor Nero in his youth. The hairstyle of this boy is similar to other portrait busts known to be of Nero, which is why many believe this one to be a younger version of him. By looking at the dates of this bust, the dates that Nero ruled, as well as the age of the boy, it seems unlikely that this was a portrait of Nero since he was thirteen when he was chosen to be Claudius’ successor as opposed to the boy represented in this portrait (see the [Nero](../emperor-hairstyles/nero.md) section for more). Nevertheless, this portrait is proof of the desire, by the public, to model themselves in the semblance of the royal family.<sup><a id="fnref1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup>

"This life-sized statue was found on the eastern Mediterranean island of Rhodes, whose ancient Greek cities were wealthy, flourishing centers ofcommerce and culture under the Romans. With his broad face and short hair, the boy resembles young princes in the family of Augustus, the first Roman emperor, but he may have been the son of an important Roman official stationed on Rhodes or the son of a wealthy Greek. As Roman influence spread throughout the Mediterranean world, there was interchange of fashion, customs, and culture. Romans had great admiration for Greek culture; the island of Rhodes was famous for its schools of philosophy and rhetoric, and this boy even wears a Greek himation (cloak) instead of the traditional Roman toga."
