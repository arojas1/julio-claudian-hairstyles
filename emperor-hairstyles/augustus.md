## Imperator Caesar Divi Filius Augustus (a.k.a Augustus)
<br>

### Background
Augustus was the first Roman emperor, taking over after his great-uncle and adoptive father, Julius Ceaser. He ruled from 27 B.C until his death in A.D 14.<sup><a id="fnref1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> During his reign, Augustus nearly doubled the size of the empire as well as strengthened Roman infrastructure. After his death, he was declared to be a god by the Roman Senate.<sup><a id="fnref2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup>

Augustus, being the first Roman emperor, was the one to set the precedent for the Julio-Claudian portraitures and hairstyles. Moving on from the late Republic veristic (naturalistic) representations of portraits, where they represented all the flaws of a person (such as baldness, wrinkles, etc.) Augustus took inspiration from the Hellenistic Greek portraits and decided to represent himself in an idealized way.<sup><a id="fnref3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> This is evident in the fact that none of the portraits throughout Augustus' reign portray him in old age (that have been found), despite him living until he was 77 years old.<sup><a id="fnref4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup>

### Portraiture

The portrait in figure 1 very clearly has the "crab-claw" part, signifying the portrait is a part of the Julio-Claudian period. Although the portriat is broken in the back, we can assume that the portrait would have had the hair locks eminating in the signature star-like spiral. This portrait is over-lifesized. This scale is typically reserved for depictions of rulers or gods.

Here is another example of a portrait of Augustus. Once again, the "crab-claw" is prominent in the front. Looking at the back, however, the star-like shape of the locks is prominent on this portrait.
