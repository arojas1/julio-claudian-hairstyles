# Emperor's Hairstyles

Starting with Julius Caesar, later emperors would use artistic motifs of their predecessors in order to portray certain political messages to the public. Some people would even emulate the artistic style of royal portraits in their own portraits to show their appreciation for the royal family and raise their stature (see *[Aristocratic Hairstyles](../aristocratic-hairstyles/aristocratic-hairstyles.md)*). One of the characteristic styles of the Julio-Claudian period was the Augustan hair style, which had a parting in the hair over the inner corner of the left eye and the “crab-claw” or “pincer” motif over the right eye leaving a distinctive V-shape. Another characteristic that is included in the Augustan hair style, though not as prominent, is the waves of hair originating from one point on the back of the head and spanning out in a light, star-like shape.

This section will look at each emperor individually and discuss the similarities and differences each hairstyle has.
