## Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus (a.k.a Nero)
<br>

### Background

Nero, who reigned from A.D. 54-68, was adopted at the age of thirteen by the emperor at that time, Claudius (reign from A.D. 41-54), and rose to power at the age of seventeen.<sup><a id="fnref1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup>

Similar to Caligula, Nero was not very popular amongst the people. He was declared a public enemy and, before he was captured and punished to death, he killed himself, being one of the first emperors to commit suicide.<sup><a id="fnref2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> After his death he was condemned to *damnatio memoriae*.<sup><a id="fnref3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> The portraits of Nero were altered to represent the emperor Vespasian, his sons, or Divus Augustus.<sup><a id="fnref4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup>

Nero was the first to try to take the Augustan hair style and make it his own. Breaking from tradition, Nero's portraits wore his hair long in the front, but also kept the comma-shaped hair locks. Another characteristic for Nero was having long side burns. In some portraits of Caligula, he had slight side burns as well. By breaking from tradition and having a feature similar to Caligula did not help with Nero's public image.<sup><a id="fnref5" href="#fn5">5</a></sup>
