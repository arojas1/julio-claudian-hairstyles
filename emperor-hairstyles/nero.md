## Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus (a.k.a Nero)
<br>

### Background

Nero, who reigned from A.D. 54-68, was adopted at the age of thirteen by the emperor at that time, Claudius (reign from A.D. 41-54), and rose to power at the age of seventeen.<sup><a id="fnref1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup>

Similar to Caligula, Nero was not very popular amongst the people. He was declared a public enemy and, before he was captured and punished to death, he killed himself, being one of the first emperors to commit suicide.<sup><a id="fnref2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup> After his death he was condemned to *damnatio memoriae*.<sup><a id="fnref3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup> The portraits of Nero were altered to represent the emperor Vespasian, his sons, or Divus Augustus.<sup><a id="fnref4" href="#fn4">4</a></sup>
