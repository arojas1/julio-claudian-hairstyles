## Physical Representations of Emperors

 

The similar characteristics between the two busts, despite being part of the Julio-Claudian line, could also be a representation of their familial connection, Caligula being the uncle of Nero, if the boy is in fact Nero. If not, you can still see the influence of the Julio-Claudian style. The hairstyle of the curls at the back of the head spiraling out from one point are similar, although not as prominent on the bust of Caligula as on the boy in fig. 2. The ears in both busts are larger than is proportionate,as are the eyes. The one characteristic that connects the two to the family line, however, is the front of the hair. Both have the split of the hair on their foreheads, although not as visible on the bust of Caligula. The fact that Caligula does not have as prominent of a hair part as the boy in fig. 2 could be because the portraits of Caligula are very recognizable (as he is the emperor) whereas the boy needs to have the features stand out more in order to draw a connection to the royal family.
