## Tiberius Caesar Divi Augusti Filius Augustus (a.k.a Tiberius)
<br>

### Background
Tiberius (r. 14–37 A.D.), the stepson of Augustus, rose to power the death of Augustus. This was after Augustus' other previously chosen successors died.(https://harvardartmuseums.org/art/311091) Although Tiberius was not actually related to Augustus, but his portraits portray a remarkable, and fictionalized, resemblance that connected him to Augustus and helped substantiate his position as successor.

Although it is not as prominent in this bust as in the Augustus ones, Tiberius has the same "crab-claw" parting of his hair at the front. Another feature of the Augustan-style, that is more prominent in this bust as opposed to those of Agustus, is the comma-shaped hair locks along the forehead.
