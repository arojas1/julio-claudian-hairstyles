## Tiberius Caesar Divi Augusti Filius Augustus (a.k.a Tiberius)
<br>

### Background
Tiberius (r. 14–37 A.D.), the stepson of Augustus, rose to power after the death of Augustus. This was after Augustus' other previously chosen successors died before himself.<sup><a id="fnref1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> Although Tiberius was not actually related to Augustus, his portraits portray a remarkable, and fictionalized, resemblance that connected him to Augustus and helped substantiate his position as successor.<sup><a id="fnref2" href="#fn2">2</a></sup>

Although it is not as prominent in this bust as in the Augustus ones, Tiberius has the same "crab-claw" parting of his hair at the front. Another feature of the Augustan-style, that is more prominent in this bust as opposed to those of Agustus, is the comma-shaped hair locks along the forehead.

Portraits of the Emperors can appear in many forms such as busts, statues, coins, and, in the case of figure 2, plaques. This plaque although just a side portrait, still has to follow the hairstyles of the time to help identify the subject.

Although the "crab-claw" motif cannot be seen here, the comma-style of the hair locks is clearly visible. One hair feature that is unique to Tiberius is the long hair on the back of the neck. This was said to be a family trait by the Roman historian, Suetonius.<sup><a id="fnref3" href="#fn3">3</a></sup>
